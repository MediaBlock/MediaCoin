# MediaCoin
The goal of this project is to build a media service protocol on blockchain that helps to solve the piracy issues currently facing the media industry.

Using blockchain we can secure the media that is being distributed on the internet. And the people get paid appropiately. 

The blockchain will essentially be utilised as such and those who produce consume content will have to pay to those who wish to streamline the content.

Though, it would be difficult to solve the privacy issues but it would make making digital content more easily accessible to everyone at a cheaper cost. Or at a cost competitive to those of other media.

The user would have to pay for the content depending upon various factors such as the popularity of the media, size of the media being fetched and various other related factors.
